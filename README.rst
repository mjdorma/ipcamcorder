ipcamcorder - IP Camera Recorder 
********************************

IPCamcorder (IP Camera Recorder) allows users to define multiple IP Camera (or
JPG URI) sources for realtime video encoding.  The Recorder downloads and
decodes JPG images then encodes them into a DIVX .avi video container.  

Decoding and encoding of images into video is done by using the OpenCV library.
